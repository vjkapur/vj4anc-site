## Background
The subject property is currently an empty gravel-covered lot owned by New Macedonia Baptist Church. New Macedonia Baptist Church operated adjacent to it, in the church building at 3200 22nd St. NE, and used the vacant lot as parking and an outdoor event space.

Both properties are being prepared for redevelopment. The church is no longer interested in occupying the building, and any kind of use would require substantial rehabilitation. The church has contracted with [Feldman Ruel](http://www.feldmanruel.com/) to have each property entitled for redevelopment and then sold. The proceeds will benefit the church, which is setting up new facilities closer to their congregants.

The church building itself, 3200 22nd St. NE, is planned to be residential only and has already received BZA approval as a separate case.

## The Project
The gravel lot is planned to be mixed-use, with retail/restaurant spaces on the ground floor and residences on top. There will also be underground parking.

The tentative plans would include retail frontage buffered from the nearby detached houses on Jackson, along the corner abutting Rhode Island Ave. NE. It would include a possible sidewalk cafe within the footprint of the building (not in public space) along that corner. Parking garage access would be on 22nd St. NE, inbetween the retail and the planned homes in 3200 22nd.

<p class="caption">2026 Jackson rendering, from the northeast</p>

There would be approximately 35 homes, 3,000 square feet of retail, and 5-6 parking spaces. This makes it comparable to (but smaller than) 2027 Rhode Island Ave. NE (located on the other side of Rhode Island Ave. and just a little bit southwest). See the table for comparison.

|building|homes|sq. ft. retail|parking spaces|
|---|---|---|---|
|2026 Jackson St. NE|~35|~3,000|5-6|
|2027 Rhode Island Ave. NE|43|4,600|8|

## The Issues
### ZC 21-14
The ZC case concerns changing the [Zoning Map](https://maps.dcoz.dc.gov/), which broadly determines what can be built where. If approved, the parcel would change from [**`R-1-B`**](https://handbook.dcoz.dc.gov/zones/residential/R-1-B/) ("predominantly developed with detached houses on moderately sized lots"), to [**`MU-4`**](https://handbook.dcoz.dc.gov/zones/mixed-use/MU-4/) ("moderate-density mixed-use development").

In this case, there is ample context to consider the switch, as the parcel would move from matching the zone of the parcels directly north and west of it, to matching the parcels along Rhode Island Ave. NE to the northeast and southwest.

<p class="caption">2026 Jackson zoning in context, snapshotted from the official DC Zoning Map</p>

Considerations for whether ZC should make this change include harmony with the Comprehensive Plan (and [Future Land Use Map](https://planning.dc.gov/page/comprehensive-plan-future-land-use-maps)), community context, and infrastructure demands.

### future BZA case
Additional zoning relief might include specifics of the setbacks, courtyard size, or specific number of parking spaces, as examples. The considerations would be less drastic in nature, and be made with more specific building plans proposed.

## Community Action
Anyone can submit comments in support or opposition into the case record, to be considered by the ZC when judging the application. I'm happy to help regardless of your position, so feel free to reach out if you aren't sure what to write (or take a look at some letters of [support](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/Exhibits/2010/ZC/21-14/Exhibit31.pdf) and [opposition](https://app.dcoz.dc.gov/Exhibits/2010/ZC/21-14/Exhibit37.pdf) in the case record).

### Submitting a Letter
To submit a letter:
- send before 3pm **Friday 9/16/2022** to be sure it's received in time
- email it to **zcsubmissions@dc.gov**
- include the case number (`ZC 21-14`) and address (`2026 Jackson St. NE`) in the subject
- including some information about your proximity to the site, or residency within 5C07 (and/or the future 5B06) if applicable, may help strengthen the weighing of your comments

A template to start might be:
